zipfile.is_zipfile(filename)

    Returns True if filename is a valid ZIP file based on its magic number, otherwise returns False. filename may be a file or file-like object too.

    Changed in version 3.1: Support for file and file-like objects.


The module defines the following items:

exception zipfile.BadZipFile

    The error raised for bad ZIP files.

    New in version 3.2.

exception zipfile.BadZipfile

    Alias of BadZipFile, for compatibility with older Python versions.

    Deprecated since version 3.2.

exception zipfile.LargeZipFile

    The error raised when a ZIP file would require ZIP64 functionality but that has not been enabled.







ZipFile.extract(member, path=None, pwd=None)

    Extract a member from the archive to the current working directory; member must be its full name or a ZipInfo object. Its file information is extracted as accurately as possible. path specifies a different directory to extract to. member can be a filename or a ZipInfo object. pwd is the password used for encrypted files.

    Returns the normalized path created (a directory or new file).

    Note

    If a member filename is an absolute path, a drive/UNC sharepoint and leading (back)slashes will be stripped, e.g.: ///foo/bar becomes foo/bar on Unix, and C:\foo\bar becomes foo\bar on Windows. And all ".." components in a member filename will be removed, e.g.: ../../foo../../ba..r becomes foo../ba..r. On Windows illegal characters (:, <, >, |, ", ?, and *) replaced by underscore (_).

    Changed in version 3.6: Calling extract() on a closed ZipFile will raise a ValueError. Previously, a RuntimeError was raised.

    Changed in version 3.6.2: The path parameter accepts a path-like object.







ZipFile.read(name, pwd=None)

    Return the bytes of the file name in the archive. name is the name of the file in the archive, or a ZipInfo object. The archive must be open for read or append. pwd is the password used for encrypted files and, if specified, it will override the default password set with setpassword(). Calling read() on a ZipFile that uses a compression method other than ZIP_STORED, ZIP_DEFLATED, ZIP_BZIP2 or ZIP_LZMA will raise a NotImplementedError. An error will also be raised if the corresponding compression module is not available.

    Changed in version 3.6: Calling read() on a closed ZipFile will raise a ValueError. Previously, a RuntimeError was raised.





 ZipFile.testzip()

    Read all the files in the archive and check their CRCâ€™s and file headers. Return the name of the first bad file, or else return None.

    Changed in version 3.6: Calling testfile() on a closed ZipFile will raise a ValueError. Previously, a RuntimeError was raised







ZipFile.comment

    The comment text associated with the ZIP file. If assigning a comment to a ZipFile instance created with mode 'w', 'x' or 'a', this should be a string no longer than 65535 bytes. Comments longer than this will be truncated in the written archive when close() is called.
